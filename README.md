# Chess Engine

This is going to be a simple chess engine allowing local matches between two humans, human vs CPU or CPU vs CPU.
There are two reasons for its creation. I wanna improve my understanding of chess and I wanna train my C++ skills
as my work doesn't allow me to do that currently.

# Usage

Currently tthis does not do much besides setting up a board start position and printing it on the screen
