# Ideas

* Unicode chess pieces for debug output
* Generic state / move tree for chess but also for other games. A node is a state, current board position. An edge is a move from one position to the next.
* Add support for UCI https://www.shredderchess.com/chess-features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html
* Implement debug output based on [Algebraic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess))
