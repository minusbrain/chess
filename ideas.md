# Ideas

* Unicode chess pieces for debug output
* Generic state / move tree for chess but also for other games. A node is a state, current board position. An edge is a move from one position to the next.
* Add support for UCI https://www.shredderchess.com/chess-features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html
    * Accept board states as UCI string
* Collect debug output in one file and move as much as possible into a source file
*
